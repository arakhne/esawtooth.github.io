This one is an old story that occured during my time with Intel Bangalore. I and a few of my friends were discussing cool ideas as usual, and Shobhit hit upon the idea of doing some social entrepreneurship projects. One thought that came evolved eventually from that was the need to popularize innovation in rural areas. It would of course be necessary to figure out aspects of the village lifestyle and the problems they face, in order to appreciate innovations in that regard.

I visited the Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) with a few friends from work sometime last year. Well, to be more precise, our objective was to visit a village near the town and observe some aspects of the rustic life. This is a travelog of sorts based on that visit.
