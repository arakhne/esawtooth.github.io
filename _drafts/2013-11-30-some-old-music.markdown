I play the guitar occasionally. The pieces below were all played through a 2004 mexican Stratocaster, and amplified by a Fender SuperSonic 22 unit. The recording was done by an iPhone 4 microphone. The bass is rather lacking as a result. I will need to figure out a better recording solution that that someday.

     


* I really liked the second solo on the song **On an Island** by David Gilmour. Here is a quick rendering. The aeolian mode has been used from within the E minor pentatonic sparingly and very tastefully.

* And here is **Little Wing** from Jimi Hendrix. This classic needs no introduction, even if the recording below is an attempt at precisely that part of the song.

* Classical Guitar is fun as well. This is **Romance d'Amour**. It has a three-part form, the first and third being in minor key and the second in major
